title: Rectangle to move applications between screens on MacOs
---

MacOs lack tool for easily moving application between your screens (or share one screen between two application). On windows it was quite easy and intuitive with keyboard shortcuts **Win + Left Arrow** or **Win + Right Arrow**, etc.

## Installing

I am using [brew](https://brew.sh/) as a Package Manager and I also recomend it for everybody.

``` sh
brew install --cask rectangle
```

[//]: # "After installing you need to..."


## Keyboard Shortcuts

Move on one screen:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Keyboard-basic-shortcuts-in-Rectangle.png)

and maximize:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Maximize-in-Rectangle.png)

So far we was on one screen. When we want to move application between screens, there are:

- Control(⌃) + Option(⌥) + Command(⌘) + Left/Right Arrow.

(just believe, hard to show on one screen)

## Save your teams time

I sometimes see somebody at work strugling with moving windows around and between screens. Mostly on calls when somebody have to share the screen. If you also have this problem you can send this video to them :)

[//]: # "move to corners"
