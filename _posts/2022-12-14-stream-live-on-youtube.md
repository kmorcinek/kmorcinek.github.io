title: Stream live on youtube

Using [Restream](https://app.restream.io/home) as in [How to share screen on Facebook Live, YouTube Live + (Livestream screensharing w/Restream tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htU4G-mRRyg/) .

But first create scheduled "live" in youtube (when for testing it should be "unlisted"). Only after it add an youtube event as a destination in restream.
